**Update** — Hardened the Reddit Ads client's ambiguous-outcome classification
(PR #27): redirect following is force-disabled on every client used, including
one supplied via `WithHTTPClient` (`CheckRedirect` is overridden to
`http.ErrUseLastResponse` on a shallow copy, so the caller's client is not
mutated). This makes `isPreSendDialError`'s `*tls.CertificateVerificationError`
branch sound — a cert error then proves the ORIGINAL request's handshake failed
pre-send, since no redirect could carry an already-sent POST to a TLS-broken
target. `tls.RecordHeaderError` was REMOVED from `isPreSendDialError`: it can
surface post-negotiation while reading a response, so it does not prove pre-send
and now flows to the UNCONFIRMED path. A 3xx on a MUTATING request is classified
UNCONFIRMED (it reached a responder and may have committed before redirecting); a
3xx on a GET is not a create. Context errors and 5xx/mid-flight transport
failures also stay UNCONFIRMED. Reworded the manual-fallback UTM step to
SET/REPLACE the utm_* params (matching `buildRedditUTMURL`'s `url.Values.Set`).

**Creation** — Added OKF concept doc for internal/platform/meta (Meta Ads Graph
API client) with `tags`/`timestamp` frontmatter (queryable fields per OKF v0.1
§4.1), listed in the code index.

**Update** — Added OKF-recommended `tags` and `timestamp` frontmatter to the
internal/platform/reddit concept doc (queryable fields per OKF v0.1 §4.1).

**Update** — Addressed Copilot review on the X/Twitter Ads client (PR #19):
create calls now send params as URL query parameters (not a JSON body) per the
X Ads v12 contract, use `entity_status=PAUSED`, and line items carry the
required `start_time`/`end_time` with `bid_strategy` (not `bid_type`); dates are
strictly parsed to reject impossible calendar values; name lookups propagate
errors instead of masking them as not-found. Added the
`internal/platform/twitter` code concept and index entry.

**Update** — Mount connection routes in the HTTP server (LFXV2-2556): the
`cmd/campaign-service` concept now notes that every container-wired service
must also be mounted in `server.go`, or its routes 404 despite compiling.

**Creation** — Added the `internal/platform/reddit` concept doc for the new
Reddit Ads API v3 client (OAuth2 token refresh + Campaign -> Ad Group -> Ad
creation) and listed it in the code index.

**Update** — Dropped the Goa CLI path allowlist; twitter-api-secret FP is
fingerprint-only in `.gitleaksignore`. Clarified `.grype.yaml` rationale
(Engine fixes exist; Go module path not yet upgradeable via migrate/dktest).

**Update** — Absorbed PR #18 grype fixes into the MegaLinter secrets work:
added `.grype.yaml` (ignore five transitive test-only `docker/docker`
CVEs) and `REPOSITORY_GRYPE_ARGUMENTS` in `.mega-linter.yml`. Kept the
narrower gitleaks allowlists from PR #24 (not #18's broad `^gen/`).

**Update** — Documented local MegaLinter/Docker workflow and tightened
`.gitleaks.toml` allowlists (narrow Goa CLI path + `.gitleaksignore`
fingerprint for twitter-api-secret false positive; sample AES key limited
to docs + `values.local.example.yaml`). Added architecture concept
`megalinter-secrets.md`.

**Update** — Wired `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` into the Helm chart and local docs (required whenever a DB URL is configured so `/readyz` can start). Documented a non-production local sample key.

**Update** — Documented PostgreSQL readiness on `/readyz` (LFXV2-2559): updated service/config/container/constants concepts, added `internal/infrastructure/postgres` concept, noted PG* secret injection on Deployment, and added the `002-db-conn-check` feature-spec subtree.

**Creation** — initial OKF knowledge bundle generated from existing docs, Helm charts, Go packages, and speckit specs.
