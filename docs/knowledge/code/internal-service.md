# internal/service

Package service contains the campaign service business logic, including the
implementation of the generated Goa service interfaces.

`GET /readyz` ANDs an optional `ReadinessChecker` (the PostgreSQL pool when
wired) into readiness with a ~2s timeout and returns `503` when the dependency
is unhealthy. `GET /livez` remains process-only so database outages do not
trigger Kubernetes restarts.

`AudienceService` implements the built-audience endpoints (the "B2" resource,
epic LFXV2-2770): create/get/list/update of a `campaign_audiences` row subordinate
to a brief. An audience is a POINTER + provenance to a platform-side audience (a
HubSpot master contact list), NOT its contents. Update is optimistic-concurrency
gated on `If-Match` (same strong-validator parsing as briefs); the ETag mirrors the
row version. Like the other services it late-binds via `SetBackend` after a
cold-start DB retry and returns a typed `503` (routes mounted) when no repo is wired.

`BriefService` implements brief CRUD and campaign endpoints. Campaign creation
(`CreateCampaigns`) requires an approved brief, rejects empty and duplicate
platform sets (a duplicate would create two paid upstream campaigns), then hands
off to the `Orchestrator`, which persists a job and dispatches per platform
asynchronously (bounded concurrency). Dispatch is idempotent: a brief already
carrying a COMPLETED campaign for a platform is reused rather than re-created. The
idempotency fast-path lookup (`GetCampaignByPlatform`) distinguishes its outcomes: an
existing campaign with an upstream id AND a terminal status (`created` /
`created_degraded`) short-circuits to reuse; a `pending` row — even one carrying an
upstream id or a Result reconcile blob — is a retained partial ORPHAN, not a
completed campaign, so it does NOT short-circuit (on retry it is reported as
reconciliation-required rather than a false success); `ErrNotFound` (no row yet) falls
through to `ClaimCampaignDispatch`; but a REAL DB error (anything else) is surfaced as
a platform failure (logged at ERROR) rather than silently treated like "no existing
campaign" — proceeding to
claim/dispatch when an existing campaign merely couldn't be loaded could duplicate an
upstream create, so it fails loud instead. Replacing a brief's
content resets it to `draft` (re-approval required). Optimistic concurrency is enforced via
version/If-Match (`428` when missing, `412` on mismatch).

Dispatch is durable (LFXV2-2665): single-flight per (brief, platform) is
enforced by an atomic claim — `ClaimCampaignDispatch` does INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
DO NOTHING of a `pending` campaign row, so exactly one worker across replicas
wins the claim (the unique index arbitrates) with no held connection or blocking
lock. A worker that loses the claim reuses the existing row instead of dispatching
again; the pending row also survives an upstream-create-then-crash, making the
orphaned upstream campaign recoverable. The orchestrator tracks in-flight runs
and its `Shutdown` drains them (bounded) before the DB pool closes, and on
startup jobs left non-terminal beyond a staleness cutoff are failed-forward (they
cannot be safely resumed without provider idempotency keys).

## Campaign status toggle

`BriefService.ToggleCampaignStatus` (backing `PATCH .../campaigns/{id}/status`
{active|paused}) pauses/resumes a campaign ON THE PLATFORM, then persists. Unlike
`UpdateCampaign` (DB-only), the platform call happens FIRST via
`Orchestrator.ToggleCampaignStatus` → the platform's `StatusToggler`; the DB row is written
only after the platform confirms. A stale `If-Match` fails BEFORE the paid platform call;
failures are classified (`ErrCampaignNotProvisioned` → 409 for a campaign with no upstream id
yet, `ErrToggleUnsupported` → 400, a real platform failure → 503) rather than all blamed on
the platform; and the post-platform `ReplaceCampaign` runs on `context.WithoutCancel` so the
row can't diverge from the platform if the request is cancelled after the PATCH commits.
